# Backstory_and_CharacterDesign_Generator_MortalKombat_Character
Generate backstories for Mortal Kombat character using [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT#install) and [OpenJourney](https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney).
- We train the models with Mortal Kombat characters' backstories and stable diffusion prompts


# Guide to run the model

1. Download these 2 files (because the trained model is a little bit large):
  - 'out-prompt'
  - 'out-mk-src'
  - Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12JWHDX51plbNy8r9Ip1zBjHtNAnP9fKo?usp=sharing
2. Put those files into your project folder
3. Run the model in 'sample_jp.ipynb'
