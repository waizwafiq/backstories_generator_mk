# Origin and Character Creation Generator for the Mortal Kombat Universe
Generate Mortal Kombat character backstories and design using [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT#install) and [OpenJourney](https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney).
- We train the models with Mortal Kombat characters' [backstories](https://github.com/TasnimSyamim/backstories_generator_mk/blob/main/data/mk/MK_characterdata.csv) (via [webscraping](https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_Wiki)) and midjourney [prompts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iraklip/modjourney-v51-cleaned-data)


# How to run it

## Install the Requirements
```cmd
pip install requirements.txt
```
## Follow these steps
1. Download these 2 files (because the trained model is a little bit large):
  - 'out-prompt'
  - 'out-mk-src'
  - Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12JWHDX51plbNy8r9Ip1zBjHtNAnP9fKo?usp=sharing
2. Put those files into your project folder
3. Run the model in 'sample_jp.ipynb'
